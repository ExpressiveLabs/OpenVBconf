# The OpenVBconf handbook
### Introduction
OpenVBconf is an effort by ExpressiveLabs, creators of [Mikoto Studio](https://mikoto.studio/), to develop an open voice library standard for community-driven singing synthesizers (such as UTAU, OpenUTAU, etc). To create it, we continuously collaborate with creators in the community, to ensure compatibility and usefulness for everyone.

This standard is a moving target, and we are always looking for feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas, feel free to contact us via [openvb@expressivelabs.net](mailto:openvb@expressivelabs.net), or contribute to this repository.

## OpenVBconf
OpenVBconf is an effort by ExpressiveLabs, creators of [Mikoto Studio](https://mikoto.studio/), to develop an open voice library standard for community-driven singing synthesizers (such as UTAU, OpenUTAU, etc).

### This repository
This repository contains a working copy of the standard OpenVBconf file format, as well as documentation of the format and its implementation. If you create an implementation for the file format in any programming language, feel free to contact us so we can add it to this readme.

### Implementations
